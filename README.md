# WIPA: Wavelet-integrated, Identity Preserving, Adversarial network for Face Super-resolution
This repository incluse the Pytorch implementation of the WIPA Face Super-Resolutio algorithm proposed in paper [Super-resolution of very low-resolution face images with a wavelet integrated, identity preserving, adversarial network](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0923596522000753?dgcid=coauthor).
